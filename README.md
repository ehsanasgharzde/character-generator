# Character Generator using Tkinter and Pillow

This is a simple character generator application built with Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user interface (GUI) and Pillow for image manipulation. The application allows users to customize a character's head, hair, eyes, nose, and mouth and save the generated character as an image.

## Files

The application consists of two main files:

1. **app.py**: This file contains the main code for the character generator application. It defines the `App` class, which handles the GUI and image manipulation.

2. **main.py**: This is the entry point for running the application. It creates an instance of the `App` class, loads image data, and launches the GUI.

## Features

- Users can choose from different options for the character's head, hair, eyes, nose, and mouth.
- Images for each feature are loaded from the "images/assets" directory.
- Users can clear their customization or save the generated character as an image.
- The application uses the Tkinter library for the user interface and Pillow for image handling.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

2. Install the Pillow library if it's not already installed.

3. Run the application by executing the `main.py` script.

4. The GUI will open, allowing you to customize and save characters.
